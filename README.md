##Disk Cleanup Tool
because we can, not because we should
this project was done as a mental and program excersize implementing the functionality
of some disk usage tools like WinDirStat and QDirStat

this one is implemented in Java, cause that is programming lanugage I am the most familiar doing GUI work in.

the treemap was interesting to implement and can be found in the RectPacker class utilizing the Bound record type

This project depends on Java17 and apache commons.io ( for turning # bytes into a human-readable format )
